# Task-Manager-Web-Application

This is a **Task Manager** web application built with **React** and **Vite**. I used this project as an opportunity to experiment with React hooks, axios for API calls, and Vite for fast development. The goal was to create a simple but fully functional todo list that lets users create, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete. I also wanted to make sure the frontend interacts smoothly with the backend.


### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool for React
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend
- **CSS**: To style the app
- **MongoDB**: The backend stores tasks in a MongoDB database

### Features

- Add tasks with a name and mark them as complete
- Update and delete tasks
- Responsive UI for both desktop and mobile views
- Real-time updates for task changes
